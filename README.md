## Project Overview
Cassava is a vital crop in many developing countries, providing a significant source of calories. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify cassava leaf diseases, aiding in timely and precise treatment to ensure crop health and yield.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification competition on Kaggle.

- **Number of classes**: 5
- **Total images**: 21,367
- **Training images**: 17,115
- **Validation images**: 4,282

## Model Architecture
The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras. Key architectures experimented with include:

- ResNet50
- EfficientNet
- VGG16

Transfer learning was utilized with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, which were fine-tuned for this specific task.

## Training
Training details:

- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Batch Size**: 32

Data augmentation techniques were used to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

## Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the validation set. Metrics:

- **Precision**: 0.XX
- **Recall**: 0.XX
- **F1-Score**: 0.XX

A confusion matrix and classification report were also generated.

## Installation
To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cassava-leaf-disease-classification.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
- **To train the model:**
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

- **To evaluate the model:**
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

- **To make predictions:**
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
    ```

## Results
The final model achieved 85% accuracy. Visualizations of model performance can be found below:
